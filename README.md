### Welcome to the Apple Store Application Data Exploration project! In this repository, I've utilized SQL as the primary tool to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Apple Store dataset obtained from Kaggle. The main objectives of this project include:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Leveraging SQL, I've delved deep into the dataset, unraveling its intricacies to gain valuable insights into the Apple Store applications.
* Appending Datasets: To enrich the dataset, I've incorporated additional data, enhancing the depth and breadth of our analysis.
* Insight Discovery: Through rigorous SQL queries, I've uncovered valuable insights that shed light on various aspects of the Apple Store applications.
* Final Recommendations: Drawing from the analysis, I'll conclude the project by providing actionable recommendations based on the discovered patterns and trends.


### The analysis will address key data questions, such as:
* Checking for Null values in the Apple Store dataset.
* Determining the number of apps per gender in the Apple Store.
* Providing an overview of the pricing structure within the Apple Store.
* Investigating the currencies accepted for app purchases.
* Assessing whether paid apps exhibit higher ratings compared to free ones.
* And more !

In this project we analize a data set from Netflix. Using libraries such as:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Plot
* Os

General Steps in the project:
* How to import the data from a csv
* How to deal with missing data
* Separate dates by month name, year
* Check for datatypes in dataframes
* Group and sort data
* Vizualise the data using Matplotlib and plot




# [Project 3: NBA üèÄ Web Scraping with Python](https://github.com/Fyevenes90/NBA---Web-Scraping-in-Python-using-Pandas)

Hey there, In this project I scrape the Basketball reference NBA website, to analyze the players by using powerful libraries:

* Pandas
* Seaborn

The exercise of this project is to:
* Scrape the data from a website
* Analize the data and see how some behaviors 
* Change data types and sort values
* Export data to excel
* Get a set of the 10 top players based on points

So lets get, to the code!!





# [Project 4: Nobel Prize Awarded ](https://github.com/Fyevenes90/Nobel-Prize_Awarded_from_1901_to_2019)
![Nobel_prize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28694631/172492250-a002abf9-ddf3-4905-93a4-67a6e0f43a53.JPG)

#### In this project I practice visualizations with the Nobel prize awarded data from 1901 to 2019, I will be using libraries like:
  - ploty.express
  - seaborn
  - Pandas
  - plotly.graph_objects

#### The idea of the project is to play around with the different visualization, I will do some checks in the data to make sure there's not null data and then we will conduct some visualizations:
  - In general categories in which Nobel prize have been received
  - Categories in which a man have received a Nobel Prize
  - Categories in which a woman have received a Nobel Prize
  - Countries in which a woman have received a Nobel Prize
  - Categories where a men, woman and organization have received an award
