### Welcome to the Apple Store Application Data Exploration project! In this repository, I've utilized SQL as the primary tool to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Apple Store dataset obtained from Kaggle. The main objectives of this project include:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Leveraging SQL, I've delved deep into the dataset, unraveling its intricacies to gain valuable insights into the Apple Store applications.
* Appending Datasets: To enrich the dataset, I've incorporated additional data, enhancing the depth and breadth of our analysis.
* Insight Discovery: Through rigorous SQL queries, I've uncovered valuable insights that shed light on various aspects of the Apple Store applications.
* Final Recommendations: Drawing from the analysis, I'll conclude the project by providing actionable recommendations based on the discovered patterns and trends.


### The analysis will address key data questions, such as:
* Checking for Null values in the Apple Store dataset.
* Determining the number of apps per gender in the Apple Store.
* Providing an overview of the pricing structure within the Apple Store.
* Investigating the currencies accepted for app purchases.
* Assessing whether paid apps exhibit higher ratings compared to free ones.
* And more !


# [Project 2: Netflix with Python](https://github.com/Fyevenes90/Netflix_python)

### Techniques Demonstrated:

* Importing data from a CSV file.
* Handling missing data.
* Extracting and manipulating date information.
* Checking data types in DataFrames.
* Grouping and sorting data.
* Visualizing data using Matplotlib and Plotly.
* This project provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the Netflix dataset, showcasing proficiency in data analysis and visualization techniques. The code and visualizations are available in the project repository for further exploration.

### Key Questions Explored:

* Content Focus: Investigates whether Netflix emphasizes TV shows over movies in recent years.
* Top Directors: Extracts the top 10 directors based on the number of movies they've made.
* Global Production: Determines the number of unique countries that have produced movies.
* Least Productive Year: Identifies the year with the fewest movie productions.
* TV Show Duration: Identifies the TV show with the maximum duration or seasons.
* Recent Movie Productions: Counts the number of movies produced in the last 10 years.
* and many more

# [Project 4: Nobel Prize Awarded ](https://github.com/Fyevenes90/Nobel-Prize_Awarded_from_1901_to_2019)
![Nobel_prize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28694631/172492250-a002abf9-ddf3-4905-93a4-67a6e0f43a53.JPG)

#### In this project I practice visualizations with the Nobel prize awarded data from 1901 to 2019, I will be using libraries like:
  - ploty.express
  - seaborn
  - Pandas
  - plotly.graph_objects

#### The idea of the project is to play around with the different visualization, I will do some checks in the data to make sure there's not null data and then we will conduct some visualizations:
  - In general categories in which Nobel prize have been received
  - Categories in which a man have received a Nobel Prize
  - Categories in which a woman have received a Nobel Prize
  - Countries in which a woman have received a Nobel Prize
  - Categories where a men, woman and organization have received an award
