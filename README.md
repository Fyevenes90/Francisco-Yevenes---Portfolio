### Welcome to the Apple Store Application Data Exploration project! In this repository, I've utilized SQL as the primary tool to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Apple Store dataset obtained from Kaggle. The main objectives of this project include:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Leveraging SQL, I've delved deep into the dataset, unraveling its intricacies to gain valuable insights into the Apple Store applications.
* Appending Datasets: To enrich the dataset, I've incorporated additional data, enhancing the depth and breadth of our analysis.
* Insight Discovery: Through rigorous SQL queries, I've uncovered valuable insights that shed light on various aspects of the Apple Store applications.
* Final Recommendations: Drawing from the analysis, I'll conclude the project by providing actionable recommendations based on the discovered patterns and trends.


### The analysis will address key data questions, such as:
* Checking for Null values in the Apple Store dataset.
* Determining the number of apps per gender in the Apple Store.
* Providing an overview of the pricing structure within the Apple Store.
* Investigating the currencies accepted for app purchases.
* Assessing whether paid apps exhibit higher ratings compared to free ones.
* And more !


# [Project 2: Netflix with Python](https://github.com/Fyevenes90/Netflix_python)

## Netflix analized with Python
### The analysis aims to answer key questions about Netflix's content and showcase essential data manipulation and visualization techniques. This Python project leverages popular data science libraries, to conduct an insightful Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset. such as:
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly

### Techniques Demonstrated:

* Importing data from a CSV file.
* Handling missing data.
* Extracting and manipulating date information.
* Checking data types in DataFrames.
* Grouping and sorting data.
* Visualizing data using Matplotlib and Plotly.
* This project provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the Netflix dataset, showcasing proficiency in data analysis and visualization techniques. The code and visualizations are available in the project repository for further exploration.

### Key Questions Explored:

* Content Focus: Investigates whether Netflix emphasizes TV shows over movies in recent years.
* Top Directors: Extracts the top 10 directors based on the number of movies they've made.
* Global Production: Determines the number of unique countries that have produced movies.
* Least Productive Year: Identifies the year with the fewest movie productions.
* TV Show Duration: Identifies the TV show with the maximum duration or seasons.
* Recent Movie Productions: Counts the number of movies produced in the last 10 years.
* and many more





# [Project 3: NBA 🏀 Web Scraping with Python](https://github.com/Fyevenes90/NBA---Web-Scraping-in-Python-using-Pandas)

Hey there, In this project I scrape the Basketball reference NBA website, to analyze the players by using powerful libraries:

* Pandas
* Seaborn

The exercise of this project is to:
* Scrape the data from a website
* Analize the data and see how some behaviors 
* Change data types and sort values
* Export data to excel
* Get a set of the 10 top players based on points

So lets get, to the code!!





# [Project 4: Nobel Prize Awarded ](https://github.com/Fyevenes90/Nobel-Prize_Awarded_from_1901_to_2019)
![Nobel_prize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28694631/172492250-a002abf9-ddf3-4905-93a4-67a6e0f43a53.JPG)

#### In this project I practice visualizations with the Nobel prize awarded data from 1901 to 2019, I will be using libraries like:
  - ploty.express
  - seaborn
  - Pandas
  - plotly.graph_objects

#### The idea of the project is to play around with the different visualization, I will do some checks in the data to make sure there's not null data and then we will conduct some visualizations:
  - In general categories in which Nobel prize have been received
  - Categories in which a man have received a Nobel Prize
  - Categories in which a woman have received a Nobel Prize
  - Countries in which a woman have received a Nobel Prize
  - Categories where a men, woman and organization have received an award
